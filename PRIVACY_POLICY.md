## Perfect Gym Coach: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Perfect Gym Coach app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Alessio Galatolo. The source code is available on GitHub under no license (atm).

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences, name, age, etc.) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

`BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE` is used to access music playing on device (if any). So that it can also be controlled from within the app. This permission still requires manual user confirmation.

### Contact information
If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact: [galatoloalessio@gmail.com](mailto:galatoloalessio@gmail.com)
