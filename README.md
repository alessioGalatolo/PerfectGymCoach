# PerfectGymCoach
A gym workout app born from the frustration of using badly designed apps with terrible UX and infinite number of paywalls

## Disclaimer
This app is pretty much a mess, it is open source as I've had this habit for quite some time now but it probably shouldn't /(ㄒoㄒ)/~~

Feel free to contribute/make any suggestion for this project :)
